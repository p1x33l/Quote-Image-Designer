# Quote-Image-Designer
Automation for Scraping Quotes and Creating Radbubble Designs
## Overview
This is a Python script to collect quotes from a website and generate images for each quote. The script is written in Python and uses the following libraries: Requests, BeautifulSoup, CSV, os, re, PIL, Pandas, Textwrap

## Quotes Collector

The script `quotes_collector.py` collects quotes and authors from the website https://www.azquotes.com/top_quotes.html and stores the data in a CSV file. The script collects quotes and authors from only 2 pages of the website to prevent overloading the website.

## Image Designer

The script `img_designer.py` reads the quotes and authors from the CSV file generated by the `quotes_collector.py` script and generates an image for each quote and author. The images are saved in the `results` folder with unique filenames.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the `quotes_collector.py` script to collect the quotes and authors.
3. Run the `img_designer.py` script to generate the quote images.

## Note

The script assumes that the font file `Quote.ttf` and `Oswald.ttf` are in the same directory. If the font files are not in the same directory, the path to the font files needs to be updated in the script.
